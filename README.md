# Simple-Python-Music-Player
This repository contains a simple music player python script that utilized the pygame, sqlite3, and pyqt6 libraries. 
The script functions by checking the library/SONG folder for mp3 and flacc files and then creating a database which references these files.
The database stores refrences to the song files which are then read and played by the pygame mixer. If there are no songs within the folder the music player
will not work
